When working with large codebases, it's common to have multiple branches that can get out of sync with the main branch. Here are some strategies and commands to help manage this scenario:

### Keeping Branches Updated

1. Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. Update your local main branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. Rebase your feature branch on the updated main:
   ```bash
   git checkout your-feature-branch
   git rebase main
   ```

### Handling Conflicts During Rebase

If you encounter conflicts during rebase:

1. Resolve the conflicts in each file.
2. Add the resolved files:
   ```bash
   git add resolved-file.py
   ```
3. Continue the rebase:
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```
4. If you need to abort the rebase:
   ```bash
   git rebase --abort
   ```

### Using Interactive Rebase

Interactive rebase allows you to modify commits in your branch:

```bash
git rebase -i main
```

This opens an editor where you can reorder, squash, or edit commits.

### Creating a Topic Branch

For complex features, create a topic branch off your feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b topic-branch feature-branch
```

### Checking Branch Status

To see how your branch differs from main:

```bash
git diff main..your-branch
```

### Cleaning Up Old Branches

List merged branches:
```bash
git branch --merged main
```

Delete a local branch:
```bash
git branch -d branch-name
```

Delete a remote branch:
```bash
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

### Using Git Worktree

Git worktree allows you to check out multiple branches simultaneously in separate directories:

```bash
git worktree add ../path-to-new-dir branch-name
```

### Stashing Changes

If you need to switch branches but aren't ready to commit:

```bash
git stash
git checkout other-branch
# Do work on other-branch
git checkout original-branch
git stash pop
```

### Creating Patch Files

To share changes without pushing to a remote:

```bash
git diff > changes.patch
```

Apply a patch:
```bash
git apply changes.patch
```

## Best Practices for Large Codebases

1. **Regular Integration**: Frequently integrate changes from the main branch into your feature branches.
2. **Small, Focused Commits**: Make small, logical commits that are easier to review and merge.
3. **Clear Branch Naming**: Use a consistent naming convention for branches (e.g., `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`).
4. **Code Reviews**: Use pull requests for code reviews before merging into main.
5. **CI/CD**: Implement continuous integration to catch integration issues early.
6. **Documentation**: Keep your README and other documentation up-to-date.
7. **Git Hooks**: Use Git hooks to enforce code style and run tests before commits.

## Practice Exercise: Managing Multiple Branches

1. Create a new repository and add some initial files.
2. Create two feature branches: `feature-a` and `feature-b`.
3. Make changes in both feature branches and the main branch.
4. Practice rebasing `feature-a` onto the updated main branch.
5. Merge `feature-b` into main using a pull request workflow.
6. Resolve any conflicts that arise during this process.

Remember, when working with large codebases and multiple branches, communication with your team is key. Establish clear workflows and stick to them consistently.
