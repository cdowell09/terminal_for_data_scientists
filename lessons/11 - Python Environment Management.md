As a data scientist, managing Python environments is crucial for maintaining consistent, reproducible work across different projects. This lesson will cover virtual environments and package management using `venv` ,  `pip`, and `poetry`.
## Virtual Environments with venv

Virtual environments allow you to create isolated Python environments for different projects, avoiding conflicts between package versions.
### Creating a Virtual Environment

1. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your_project_directory
   ```

2. Create a new virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```

### Activating the Virtual Environment

On macOS and Linux:
```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

You'll see the environment name in your prompt when it's active.
### Deactivating the Virtual Environment

To exit the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```

## Package Management with pip

`pip` is the package installer for Python. It allows you to install and manage additional packages that are not part of the Python standard library.
### Basic pip Commands

1. Install a package:
   ```bash
   pip install package_name
   ```

2. Install a specific version:
   ```bash
   pip install package_name==1.0.4
   ```

3. Upgrade a package:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade package_name
   ```

4. Uninstall a package:
   ```bash
   pip uninstall package_name
   ```

5. List installed packages:
   ```bash
   pip list
   ```

6. Generate a requirements file:
   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

7. Install packages from a requirements file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Practice Exercise: Setting Up a Data Science Environment

1. Create a new directory for your data science project:
   ```bash
   mkdir ds_project
   cd ds_project
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv ds_env
   source ds_env/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install some common data science packages:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter ipykernel
   ```

4. Create a Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. In the notebook, verify the installed packages:
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import pandas as pd
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import sklearn

   print(f"NumPy version: {np.__version__}")
   print(f"Pandas version: {pd.__version__}")
   print(f"Matplotlib version: {plt.__version__}")
   print(f"Scikit-learn version: {sklearn.__version__}")
   ```

6. Generate a requirements file:
   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

## Tips for Data Scientists

- Always use virtual environments to keep your projects isolated and reproducible.
- Include your `requirements.txt` file in version control to ensure others can replicate your environment.
- For complex environments, look into using Docker to containerize your entire development environment.
- Regularly update your packages, but be aware of potential breaking changes in new versions.

Remember, good environment management practices are crucial for reproducible data science work and effective collaboration.

## Poetry: Modern Python Packaging and Dependency Management

Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.
### Installing Poetry

You can install Poetry using pip:

```bash
pip install poetry
```

Or using the official installer script:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

### Basic Poetry Commands

1. Create a new project:
   ```bash
   poetry new my_project
   ```

2. Initialize Poetry in an existing project:
   ```bash
   poetry init
   ```

3. Add a dependency:
   ```bash
   poetry add pandas
   ```

4. Add a development dependency:
   ```bash
   poetry add --dev pytest
   ```

5. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

6. Update dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry update
   ```

7. Run a command in the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   poetry run python my_script.py
   ```

8. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

### Managing Python Versions with Poetry

Poetry can use the Python version specified in the `pyproject.toml` file:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.8"
```

You can also specify the Python version when creating a new project:

```bash
poetry new --python 3.8 my_project
```

### Practice Exercise: Setting Up a Data Science Project with Poetry

1. Create a new data science project:
   ```bash
   poetry new ds_project_poetry
   cd ds_project_poetry
   ```

2. Add common data science packages:
   ```bash
   poetry add numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter ipykernel
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

4. Start a Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. In the notebook, verify the installed packages (same as in the venv example).

6. Exit the Poetry shell:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

## Comparing venv+pip, conda, and Poetry

- **venv+pip**: Built-in to Python, simple to use, but can be less robust for complex dependencies.
- **conda**: Powerful, handles non-Python dependencies well, popular in data science, but can be slower.
- **Poetry**: Modern, focuses on dependency resolution and reproducible builds, growing in popularity.

## Tips for Using Poetry in Data Science

- Use `poetry add` with version specifiers for precise control over package versions.
- Utilize `poetry.lock` for reproducible environments across different machines.
- Consider using Poetry's build system for packaging and distributing your own Python libraries.
- Explore Poetry's plugin ecosystem for additional functionality.

Remember, while Poetry offers many advantages, the choice between Poetry, venv+pip, and conda often depends on your specific project needs and team preferences.
